# web-scraping-challenge-AHA
Putting it all together. In this project I aim to web scrape current news alerts, weather data, and images about the planet mars. This scraped information is stored in a mongoDB. A Flask app is then created that will perform the webscrape, store the info in the database, and then display an html page with the current information, along with allowing the user to perform the scrape again. This was a proof of concept project for me, and the resultant browser page isn't intended to be the most visually appealing!

# Prerequisites 
This project uses a host of technologies. Flask, mongoDB, HTML/CSS, and python with the following modules: splinter, beautiful soup4, pandas, requests, Flask.
